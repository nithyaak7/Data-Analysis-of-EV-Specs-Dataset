# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis: Hypothesis Testing, Correlation Analysis, and Clustering

This project utilizes an extensive electric vehicle (EV) specifications dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships among key technical and performance indicators. The methodology integrates hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and clustering techniques to provide actionable insights for manufacturers, researchers, and consumers interested in EV technology.

## Hypothesis Testing

The first stage involves formulating and testing hypotheses on performance differences among various EV body typesâ€”for example, whether SUVs offer significantly greater battery capacities or ranges than hatchbacks. Employing statistical methods such as independent t-tests or ANOVA, the analysis tests for differences in means across groups (e.g., battery capacity or fast-charging power across body types). The results help identify if certain classes of vehicles are statistically favored in critical performance aspects or whether observed scatter in specifications is due to random variation.

## Correlation Analysis

The second phase focuses on exploring quantitative relationships between numerical features. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are calculated between variables such as battery capacity, range, top speed, acceleration, torque, and fast-charging power. For example, a strong positive correlation between battery capacity and range likely exists, while a negative correlation between vehicle weight (manifested through length/width/height) and efficiency may appear. This step reveals which technical factors most influence the overall performance and efficiency of EVs, highlighting where improvements could have substantial effects.

## Clustering Analysis

Finally, clustering algorithms (such as K-means or hierarchical clustering) are used to group vehicles into categories based on their specifications (e.g., range, battery size, acceleration, and power). By standardizing the data and defining optimal cluster numbers, the analysis uncovers natural groupings, such as high-performance sports EVs, long-range family vehicles, and affordable urban commuters. Each cluster's profile is analyzed, providing a basis for market segmentation and targeted product development.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive approach leverages statistical inference and machine learning to transform raw data into knowledge. Hypothesis testing validates or refutes preconceived notions, correlation analysis elucidates key relationships, and clustering uncovers hidden market segments. The findings enable better engineering decisions, more informed consumer choices, and targeted improvements in EV design and marketing.
